### Dependencies

The only dependency is OCaml (version >= 4.01). However, you will need
ocamlbuild and GNU Make to compile.

### Compiling from a terminal

Simply type "make". No need to install.

### Run the program

Type "./subml.native" to run the interpreter.
Type "./subml.native lib/nat.typ" to load the file "lib/nat.typ".

Note that you MUST run the program in the main directory (where the
"lib" directory can be accessed).
